        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>Outreach+ is a student-led platform built to connect generous donors, passionate volunteers, and trusted NGOs in one place.
Our mission is to make social contribution simple, transparent, and impactful.
You can donate money, food, or essential supplies directly to causes that matter.
A smart 1% fee supports platform maintenance and ensures operational transparency.
NGOs can post their needs and upcoming volunteer opportunities for community support.
Volunteers can browse tasks by interest, date, time, and location and apply with ease.
Emergency relief options are available to support communities during disasters or crises.
Each donation page is organized by category, making it easy to find where to help.
We aim to turn extra into enough â€” redirecting surplus food and resources to the underserved.
At Outreach+, giving is just a few clicks away, and every action creates lasting impact.
